Motivated by the development of single image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction in computer version, classic SR networks have been widely applied to the channel estimation of wireless communication system. To capture the spatial correlations in the reflection element-domain of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), we propose a multi-scale supervised learning-based Laplacian pyramid wide residual network (LapWRes) to achieve the progressive reconstruction of cascaded channel in a coarse-to-fine fashion.
