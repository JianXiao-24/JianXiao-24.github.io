A near-field wideband beamforming scheme is investigated for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which a
deep learning-based end-to-end (E2E) optimization framework
is proposed to maximize the system spectral efficiency. To deal
with the near-field double beam split effect, the base station
is equipped with frequency-dependent hybrid precoding architecture by introducing sub-connected true time delay (TTD)
units, while two specific RIS architectures, namely true time
delay-based RIS (TTD-RIS) and virtual subarray-based RIS
(SA-RIS), are exploited to realize the frequency-dependent passive beamforming at the RIS. Furthermore, the efficient E2E
beamforming models without explicit channel state information
are proposed, which jointly exploits the uplink channel training
module and the downlink wideband beamforming module. In the
proposed network architecture of the E2E models, the classical
communication signal processing methods, i.e., polarized filtering
and sparsity transform, are leveraged to develop a signal-guided
beamforming network. Numerical results show that the proposed
E2E models have superior beamforming performance and robustness to conventional beamforming benchmarks. Furthermore,
the tradeoff between the beamforming gain and the hardware
complexity is investigated for different frequency-dependent RIS
architectures, in which the TTD-RIS can achieve better spectral
efficiency than the SA-RIS while requiring additional energy
consumption and hardware cost.
