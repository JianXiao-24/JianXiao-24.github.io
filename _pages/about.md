About me
======

I received the B.Eng. degree and the M.Sc. degree (Distinction) at the [Hunan Institute of Science and Technology](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) under the supervision of Dr. [Wenwu Xie](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), in 2019 and 2022, respectively. He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with [Central China Normal University](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), advised by Dr. [Yuanwei Liu](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)  and Prof. [Guangming Huang](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). My research interests include electromagnetic information theory, reconfigurable intelligent surface, and machine learning.
