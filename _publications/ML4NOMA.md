excerpt: '1) We propose a deep adder network to achieve the sustainable NOMA modulation detection in short packet transmission of mMTC scenarios, in which the convolution operations required by traditinoal CNN architecture are replaced by the adder operations with low energy consumption. 2) We propose a multi-task federated learning framework to exploit a deep reciever architecture for cooperative MIMO-NOMA systems. 3) We propose a multi-layer data transmission scheme with non-orthogonal superimposed pilot to enhance the effective throughput of
MIMO-OFDM systems.'
