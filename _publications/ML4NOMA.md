excerpt: '1) We proposed a deep adder network to achieve sustainable NOMA modulation detection in short packet transmission of mMTC scenarios, in which the convolution operations required by traditional CNN architecture are replaced by the adder operations with low energy consumption. 2) We proposed a multi-task federated learning framework to exploit a deep receiver architecture for cooperative MIMO-NOMA systems. The above works were independently accomplished during my master training period.'
