不行无益之事，何以慰有涯之生
======

About me
======

I received the B.Eng. degree and the M.Sc. degree (Distinction) at the [Hunan Institute of Science and Technology](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) under the supervision of Dr. [Wenwu Xie](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), in 2019 and 2022, respectively. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with [Central China Normal University](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), advised by Dr. [Ji Wang](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)  and Prof. [Guangming Huang](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). I expect to conduct my doctoral defense in June 2026, and if everything goes smoothly, I am looking for a potential postdoctoral position on a global scale. I will be deeply grateful to any friend who has provided me with the opportunity. My current research interests include 
* Electromagnetic information theory
* Holographic communications
* Large model for all.
