excerpt: '1) We proposed a wavelet-driven learnable soft-thresholding network architectureto joint estimate the direct channel and cascaded channel in RIS systems at the same coherence time by learning the feature of shared pilots. 2) We propose a deep compressed sensing framework to reduce the pilot overhead of cascaded channel estimation for RIS-aided Massive MIMO communication system. 3) We propose a  Transformer empowered quantized sample framework for CSI compression and reconstruction in FDD RIS systems. 4) We propose a distributed learning-based joint channel estimation and feedback scheme for RIS-aided multi-user systems.
